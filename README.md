# README

This component is based on @yudiel/react-qr-scanner

## Usage:
1. Create a text field and assign it this custom control. This field will be populated with our Button. Press button to read a QR code. 
2. Decoded value will be stored in the field which you have to bind.
3. Two other fields are optional: button position and button label (defaults are: *right* and *Scan QR code*)
